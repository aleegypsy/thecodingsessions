                                        <p>Hey! Nice to meet you, i'm Alee, and I am a Facilitator, Trainer, and Web Developer from Darwin, Australia!

<p class="caption">I help women get their nerd on and explore the art of coding.</p>

<p>My journey into Web Development started in 2001, when I was at Uni (yes, a long time ago) studying Multimedia, 
because I wanted to be a Games Developer. The first time I ever was introduced to coding was when I 
built my first website in Flash - yes, you read that right, this dying technology was what I learnt 
to build my animated website.</p>

<p>Then I learnt C++ which both confused and intrigued me due to its sophistication, 
but this language made me interested in coding. My interest in designing websites came when I started my 
first blog on LiveJournal, and was part of some community groups where there were very few girl coders. 
I started to teach myself HTML and that is when I fell in love with Front end web design, and building and 
styling websites. I abandoned my Multimedia degree to focus on the Corporate life, but I never lost 
interest in Web Development.</p>

<p>In the years to follow, I taught myself not only HTML, but CSS and PHP 
(as I also used to run forums that were run on PHP). From there, I built a plethora of websites using HTML, CSS, 
designing templates on Wordpress and Blogger, skins/themes for forums, and designed graphics, banners and logos 
that I shared on LiveJournal and DeviantArt. Most of these were just for fun. Seriously, for fun.</p>

<p>Fast forward 10 + years later, a corporate career under my belt, and qualifications in Business Advertising, 
Training & Assessment, and now Software Development, I never lost my underlying passion for coding.</p>

<p>When I re-entered the world of Web Development, I realised there was a huge gap in the market where women only 
occupied 28% of tech jobs in Australia, and around 20% on a global scale. That's a very small number of jobs we women 
are taking up. Although the Industry itself is trying to bridge that gap by employing more and more women, there is 
unfortunately a long way to go in achieving that equilibrium, due to the fact that not so many women really are 
interested in learning to code.</p>

<p>This is where Inspirate Designs plays a role. I created this space to help make it less daunting for girl 
bosses to create their own website as well as help promote the opportunities available for women in Tech. 
Bringing my various experiences to the fold, my passion is to facilitate knowledge and excitement for you as 
women to get your nerd on and dive into the world of Tech, and enable you to drive your own learning through passion. 
<b>Because I believe that passion is the only way you will succeed in Tech.</b></p>

<p>Through <b class="caption2">The Coding Sessions</b>, you'll have access to courses and masterclasses that will teach you basics of 
how to create a career in Web Development, coding basics, exploring the types of careers you can have as a woman in Tech, 
and equip you with the skills you need in order for you to pursue, with confidence, a career in Web Development.</p>
