            <p class="container">Imagine you have worked up the confidence and made the decision to take the leap into a career in Tech. You gather
                as much information as you can, researching a variety of courses, finding resources - free, and paid, joined facbook groups to connect with like-minded 
            kick-ass females who are doing exactly what you want to do, and you think you have a pretty good idea of what you need in order to start.  You have all this information, 
            but you have no idea <em>where</em> or <em>how</em> to start. You start to feel overwhelmed, then you procrastinate, then you just end up not persuing this path because
            you feel disheartened and discouraged. You start thinking that maybe this is not for you, it's too hard, and self-doubt kicks in by telling yourself you're not good enough.
            <p><strong class="whatwedo-content uppercase">Does this sound familiar to you?</strong></p>
        </p>

        <p class="container">Or maybe you just started learning code, and you are facing block after block. You always feel like once you solve one problem, another encounter ensues, and no matter what
            you do to try and solve the problem, you can't figure it out. Self-doubt creeps in and you feel like you can't do it, and believe it's not for you. 
            <p><strong class="whatwedo-content uppercase">Is this story all too familiar? </strong></p>

        <p>Believe me, girl! I know how you feel. Because <em>i've been there.</em> That <em>was</em> me.</p>

                           <p>Was an easy one to take, once I made the decision to go down this path. It was as simple as that.
                           But learning what I needed to know by committing myself to studying at a renowned International Coding School, consume tutorials, webinars, youtube videos on the side, 
                           and following web developers who were alreay established in the industry with 10+ years experience, truly made me feel like I was just a small fish in an ocean, trying
                           to navigate her way and successfully get to the other side. It made me feel constant self-doubt, creating limiting beliefs which added blocks to my mindset, and it added this false
                           narrative to my story that just wasn't true.
                       </p>
                      
                       <p><strong>Does this resonate? Do you feel that grasping and understanding code and how to build your career from it is within your reach, but can't quite get there?</strong></p>

                       <p>When I made the decision to overcome those doubts and limiting beliefs, and stripped those thoughts right back, I realised that I was more than capable to succeed, and that all I need
                           is patience, persistence and passion. I was able to code from scratch, build several websites and web apps not only for myself, but for my clients, AND 
                           I had the capability to impart my knowledge & experience and share my journey to those who are following on a similar path to me. 
                           And guess what? I succeeded in coding my own path to success!

                       <p class="whatwedo-content2 uppercase">And you can do this too.</p>
